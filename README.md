Kode With Klossy '19 Web Development Level One Web Application

SAS solves the problem of harmful makeup by shinning a light on the lack of vegan and eco-friendly products in the cosmetic industry and provides users with alternative make up items they can purchase which benefit the environment. Our site also brings awareness to brands, like Colourpop, which are both vegan and cruelty free. Our mission is to encourage consumers to purchase eco-friendly makeup products which are safer to user and are eco-friendly.

In this project, I was primarily in charge of the HTML & CSS.
